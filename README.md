# green_crab_phys_2022: Using Hemolymph Chemistry to Predict and Assess Molting
in Green Crabs, Carcinus maenas

Objective: Develop a molting identification assay to aid in pre-molt stage 
identification in invasive green crabs

Folders: 
* data: contains .csv files with relevant data for project
* scripts: contains .Rmd file used to generate graphs and code
* figs: contains .html output for project figures

Project repository for data collected about GC hemolymph physiology. This
project was a study conducted over a 10 week period in 2022. The questions 
this study sought to assess are:

* How can biochemical parameters in hemolymph be used to predict molting?
* Are hemolymph RI, color, and calcium levels correlated?

The structure for this code base is R. All data can be found (refine data
structuring). Files are stored in the .csv format. Data files contain
information about GC tag information, condo storage, hemolymph color, protein
refractive index, and calcium levels.

My results are in the form of box plots, linear models, and power analyses.
