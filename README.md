# green_crab_phys_2022: Using Hemolymph Chemistry to Predict and Assess Molting in Green Crabs, Carcinus maenas

Objective: Develop a molting identification assay to aid in pre-molt stage 
identification in invasive green crabs

Folders: 
* data: contains .csv files with relevant data for project
* scripts: contains .Rmd file used to generate graphs and code
* figs: contains .html output for project figures

Project repository for data collected about GC hemolymph physiology. This
project was a study conducted over a 10 week period in 2022. The questions 
this study sought to assess are:

* How can biochemical parameters in hemolymph be used to predict molting?
* Are hemolymph RI, color, and calcium levels correlated?

The structure for this code base is R. All data can be found in the data folder.
Files are stored in the .csv format. Data files contain
information about GC tag information, condo storage, hemolymph color, protein
refractive index, and calcium levels from Wells Reserve (WL) and Coastal Marine
Lab (CML).
* Copy_Condo_dat_2022 contains raw data
* prelim_gc_data contains information about calcium and digital RI information
* se contains information about initial and final hemolymph levels
* wl_cml_molt_dat contains molt tracking data

My results are in the form of box plots, linear models, and power analyses.
